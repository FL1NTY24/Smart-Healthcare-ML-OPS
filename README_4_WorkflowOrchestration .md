This step involves creating a Prefect flow to automate the ML pipeline from mlops_project.py (data preprocessing, model training, and MLflow logging) and ensuring integration with your existing setup (LocalStack S3 bucket readmission-bucket and MLflow server).

Prerequisites
Existing Setup:
mlops_project.py (from Step 4) successfully logs parameters, metrics, artifacts, and registers the ReadmissionModel in MLflow.
MLflow server runs at http://127.0.0.1:5000 with SQLite backend (sqlite:///mlflow.db) and LocalStack S3 artifact storage (s3://readmission-bucket/mlflow-artifacts).
diabetes_data.csv is in C:\Users\GabrielF\patient-readmission-prediction\data.
LocalStack is running with readmission-bucket for S3 storage.

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Install Prefect
Install Prefect in your Python environment (Python 3.9.13) and update requirements.txt for reproducibility.

Steps:

Install Prefect:
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
py -m pip uninstall prefect griffe -y
py -m pip install prefect==2.14.0
Verify installation:
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
prefect --version
Expected: 2.14.0.
Update requirements.txt in C:\Users\GabrielF\patient-readmission-prediction:
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
echo prefect==2.14.0 >> requirements.txt
Ensure requirements.txt contains:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
mlflow==2.17.0
scikit-learn==1.2.2
pandas==1.5.3
matplotlib==3.7.5
seaborn==0.13.2
prefect==2.14.0
2. Verify MLflow and LocalStack Setup
Ensure the MLflow server and LocalStack are running to support the Prefect flow.

Steps:

Start MLflow Server (if not running):
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
cd C:\Users\GabrielF
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root s3://readmission-bucket/mlflow-artifacts --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
Verify: Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in a browser to see the MLflow UI.
Start LocalStack (if not running):
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
docker ps
docker run -d -p 4566:4566 -p 4510-4559:4510-4559 --env SERVICES=s3,sns --env HOSTNAME_EXTERNAL=localhost --env S3_PATH_STYLE=1 localstack/localstack
Set Environment Variables:
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
$env:AWS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE = "true"
$env:AWS_ENDPOINT_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:4566"
Verify S3 Bucket:
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
awslocal s3 ls s3://readmission-bucket/
Expected: PRE data/ PRE mlflow-artifacts/.
Silence Git Warning (optional, for cleaner logs):
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
$env:GIT_PYTHON_REFRESH = "quiet"
3. Create pipeline.py
Create a Prefect flow in pipeline.py to orchestrate the ML pipeline, modularizing the preprocessing, training, evaluation, and MLflow logging from mlops_project.py.

Steps:

Create pipeline.py in C:\Users\GabrielF\patient-readmission-prediction with the following code:

Save the file:
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
cd C:\Users\GabrielF\patient-readmission-prediction
Create pipeline.py with the above code using a text editor or:
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
echo [paste the above code] > pipeline.py
4. Start Prefect Server
Run the Prefect server to monitor the flow execution.

Steps:

Start the Prefect server:
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
prefect server start
Expected: Server starts, and you can access the Prefect UI at http://127.0.0.1:4200.
Open a new PowerShell terminal to keep the server running.
5. Run the Prefect Flow
Execute pipeline.py to run the orchestrated pipeline.

Steps:

Ensure MLflow server and LocalStack are running (from Step 2).
Run the flow:
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
cd C:\Users\GabrielF\patient-readmission-prediction
python pipeline.py
Monitor execution in the Prefect UI (http://127.0.0.1:4200). Expect a flow run named “Patient Readmission Prediction Pipeline” with tasks (configure_environment, etc.) marked as completed.
6. Verify Outputs
Confirm the pipeline logged to MLflow and stored artifacts in LocalStack.

Steps:

MLflow UI:
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Check the “PatientReadmission” experiment for a new run with:
Parameters: n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, random_state=42.
Metrics: auc_roc, precision, recall.
Artifacts: random_forest_model, confusion_matrix.png.
Model: ReadmissionModel (new version, e.g., Version 2) in the “Models” tab.
LocalStack S3:
powershell

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
awslocal s3 ls s3://readmission-bucket/mlflow-artifacts/ --recursive
Expected: New artifacts under mlflow-artifacts/1/ (or a new experiment ID) with confusion_matrix.png and model files (model.pkl, etc.).
Prefect UI:
Open http://127.0.0.1:4200.
Verify the flow run completed successfully with all tasks (preprocessing, training, etc.) marked as completed.
